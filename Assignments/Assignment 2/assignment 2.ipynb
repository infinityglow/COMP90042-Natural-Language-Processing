You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training.

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space). Complete the `bigram_guesser` method (use the second answer space). Note that the method currently only has one additional argument (`bigram_counts`), but you are free to add additional arguments."

    "The approach we use is interpolation, which means combining different order n-gram models. The unigram model simply counts the frequency of each character, and then normalizes to get the probability distribution. The bigram model has two versions: forward and backward. The forward bigram model predicts the probability of occurence of the current character given the previous character, i.e. $p(w_i|w_{i-1})$, while the backward bigram model predicts the probability of occurence of the current character given the next character, i.e. $p(w_i|w_{i+1})$. For robustness, we use Laplace smoothing to handle zero probability. There are three trigram models. The first one is forward trigram, which predicts the probability of current character given the previous two consecutive characters, i.e. $p(w_i|w_{i-1}, w_{i-2})$. The second one is backward trigram, which predicts the probability of current character given the next two consecutive characters, i.e. $p(w_i|w_{i+1}, w_{i+2})$. The last one is in-between trigram, which makes prediction based on the previous one character and the next character, i.e. $p(w_i|w_{i-1}, w_{i+1})$. Similar to bigram, we also introduce Laplace smoothing to deal with zero probability. The final step is guess a word based on the models. For each case, we add a weight term to the probability distribution over all alphabetic letter, then the weighted sum of probability distribution is used to choose the best guessed character.\n",
